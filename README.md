# The 100 Days Of Code Challenge
This challenge is inspired by [Alexander Kallaway's](https://github.com/Kallaway)  [100 Days of Code](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code). 

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
June 1, 2017. 

## The Rules
1. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
2. I will push code to GitHub every day so that I can see my progress.
3. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress.
4. This is for my own personal accountability and learning. It is first and 
foremost a project for me first, and no one else.
