# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Started playing with a few things and then settled on going through Data viz and with Python and JS more methodically. Spent a few hours reading and setting up the dev and virtualenv environment.  


**Thoughts**: 
This is day one, I'm excited but really hope that I can keep this up. I like setting up devs and using the CLI.
