# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Started playing with a few things and then settled on going through Data viz and with Python and JS more methodically. Spent a few hours reading and setting up the dev and virtualenv environment.  

**Thoughts**: 
This is day one, I'm excited but really hope that I can keep this up. I like setting up devs and using the CLI.

Tomorrow start again at: Basic Bridge Work


### Day 2: June 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Mostly read rather than coded. Learnt about the fundamental differences between Python and JS. Spent ~2hours.

**Thoughts**: 
Looking forward to doing more practice, although this was useful.

Tomorrow start again at: Differences in Practice

### Day 3: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Finished Chapter 2 of the book. Still didn't code too much but now have a better understanding of some of the syntactic differences between Python and Js. Just played around with the examples to practice typing up syntax. ~ 1hr

**Thoughts**: 
I will probably forget some of the stuff I've learnt here, but I guess that it'll come back to me over time or as I need it. Despite it being Saturday and have spent the pm wine tasting, I still got this done :)

Tomorrow start again at: Chapter 3 Reading and Writing Data with Python

### Day 4: June 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Today, worked on writing and reading data using the Python CSV module. 1hr.

**Thoughts**: 
This is all catching up on some basic knowledge. Looking forward to coding more. But despite it being Sunday, having a headache and spending most of the day in a car, I've showed up.  \(• ◡ •)/ 

Tomorrow start again at: JSON

### Day 5: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked on writing and reading data using the json module for Python. Began reading and writing data using SQLAlchemy. 1hr.

**Thoughts**: 
I know this stuff is useful, but looking forward to learning things that are more directly related. Worked on this first thing in the morning. Not sure yet if this is the best time to do this yet. It's true that it's now done, but really I'd like to be spending more than an hour right now to whiz past this first part. I might pick up again a bit later if I have time.

Tomorrow start again at: Querying the Database

## Day 6: June 7, 2017*

**Today's Progress**: 
Learnt how to query the database with SQLAlchemy and then converted objects returned by the session into Python dicts. Couldn't get the Dataset module working and don't have time to debug right now, so will leave it to tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: 
I fell off the bandwagon yesterday, unexpected things happened and I didn't have time. I was surprised to feel disappointed and was kind of looking forward to it. But it's ok, cuz I got back on today :) This this early in the am. I wish I had more time, but if I don't do it now, I risk not doing it later as today is pretty full again.

Tomorrow start again at: Easier with Dataset
