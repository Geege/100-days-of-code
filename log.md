# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Started playing with a few things and then settled on going through Data viz and with Python and JS more methodically. Spent a few hours reading and setting up the dev and virtualenv environment.  

**Thoughts**: 
This is day one, I'm excited but really hope that I can keep this up. I like setting up devs and using the CLI.

### Day 2: June 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Mostly read rather than coded. Learnt about the fundamental differences between Python and JS. Spent ~2hours.

**Thoughts**: 
Looking forward to doing more practice, although this was useful.

Tomorrow start again at: Differences in Practice

### Day 3: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Finished Chapter 2 of the book. Still didn't code too much but now have a better understanding of some of the syntactic differences between Python and Js. Just played around with the examples to practice typing up syntax. ~ 1hr

**Thoughts**: 
I will probably forget some of the stuff I've learnt here, but I guess that it'll come back to me over time or as I need it. Despite it being Saturday and have spent the pm wine tasting, I still got this done :)

Tomorrow start again at: Chapter 3 Reading and Writing Data with Python
